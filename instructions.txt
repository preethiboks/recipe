# Title
# Vegan White Miso Ramen with Edamame and Asparagus 

# Instructions
# Put the shiitake in a heatproof bowl, cover with 200ml just-boiled water and leave to soak for five minutes. 
# In a blender, blitz the mushrooms and their soaking liquid with the onion, garlic, ginger, miso, tahini, oil, soy sauce and konbu powder.
# Heat a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, scrape the paste out of the blender and into the pan. 
# Cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the milk, little by little, until its all mixed in. 
# Make sure it doesnt boil, or it may curdle -- then add salt, if need be, and take off the heat.
# Next, cook the noodles to the packet instructions, drain, rinse under cold water and drain again.
# Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a high flame. When hot, throw in asparagus and edamame for a minute, then turn for a minute more until charred a bit.
# Add the garlic, chilli, salt and lemon juice to the pan, stir for a minute, then transfer to a bowl.
# In the same pan, heat another tablespoon of oil, if need be, then fry the tofu for a minute on each side, until golden and crisp.
# When the tofu is ready, youll be able to turn the slices easily with a spatula. Add the soy sauce for the last minute, then transfer to the asparagus bowl.
# To assemble, divide the noodles between four bowls. Reheat the miso soup, if you need to, and share among the bowls. 
# Lay some tofu slices to one side of each bowl, share out the asparagus and edamame beans evenly, and serve hot.

Did it turn out yum? Fess up!
