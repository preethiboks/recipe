# Title
# Vegan White Miso Ramen with Edamame and Asparagus 

# Ingredients
# For the noodles
# 4 tbsp dried shiitake mushrooms
# 1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped
# 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
# 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
# 150g white miso paste, or 6 tbsp (I like Clearspring)
# 1 tbsp tahini
# 2 tbsp rapeseed oil
# 3 tbsp soy sauce
# 1 tsp konbu powder (optional)
# 1 litre soy milk (Bon Soy is particularly good)
# Salt
# 250g soba noodles (again, I use Clearspring)

# For the tofu and asparagus
# Rapeseed oil
# 250g fine asparagus
# 100g edamame beans, defrosted
# 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
# ½ tsp chilli flakes
# ⅓ tsp salt
# ½ tbsp fresh lemon juice
# 280g extra-firm tofu, cut into 0.5cm-thick slices
# 1 tbsp soy sauce

# Instructions
# Put the shiitake in a heatproof bowl, cover with 200ml just-boiled water and leave to soak for five minutes. 
# In a blender, blitz the mushrooms and their soaking liquid with the onion, garlic, ginger, miso, tahini, oil, soy sauce and konbu powder.
# Heat a nonstick frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, scrape the paste out of the blender and into the pan. 
# Cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the milk, little by little, until its all mixed in. 
# Make sure it doesnt boil, or it may curdle -- then add salt, if need be, and take off the heat.
# Next, cook the noodles to the packet instructions, drain, rinse under cold water and drain again.
# Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a high flame. When hot, throw in asparagus and edamame for a minute, then turn for a minute more until charred a bit.
# Add the garlic, chilli, salt and lemon juice to the pan, stir for a minute, then transfer to a bowl.
# In the same pan, heat another tablespoon of oil, if need be, then fry the tofu for a minute on each side, until golden and crisp.
# When the tofu is ready, youll be able to turn the slices easily with a spatula. Add the soy sauce for the last minute, then transfer to the asparagus bowl.
# To assemble, divide the noodles between four bowls. Reheat the miso soup, if you need to, and share among the bowls. 
# Lay some tofu slices to one side of each bowl, share out the asparagus and edamame beans evenly, and serve hot.
